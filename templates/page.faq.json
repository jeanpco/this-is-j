To reduce the amount of fibers that can accumulate make sure to wash inside out so that the outside of the fabric isn’t rubbing up against too many other things in the wash.<\/p>"

Next, check our size guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/thisisj.com\/pages\/womens-size-guide\">women<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/thisisj.com\/pages\/mens-size-guide\">men<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/thisisj.com\/pages\/kids-size-guide\">kids<\/a>) that provide additional measurements. Keep in mind that our bamboo fabric is extremely soft and stretchy. The measurements are taken from a relaxed garment (meaning lying flat, not on a person's body), and do not account for the additional 4\"-6” of stretch the fabric has when you put the garment on. If you’re still not sure, send us an email with some details about your height, weight and body type and the product you’re interested in and we’d be happy to make a recommendation.<\/p>"
